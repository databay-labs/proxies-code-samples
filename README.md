# Databay Residential Proxy Service
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for [Databay](https://databay.com/), a robust [residential proxy](https://databay.com/proxies/residential) service providing access to a pool of over 7 million rotating proxies. This repository is designed to help users integrate and make the most of our extensive [proxy](https://databay.com/proxies) network in their projects.

## About Databay
Databay is a leading [residential proxy](https://databay.com/proxies/residential) service that helps businesses and individuals enhance their [web scraping](https://databay.com/proxies/use-cases/web-scraping), data mining, and [SEO](https://databay.com/proxies/use-cases/seo-monitoring) efforts. With over 7 million rotating proxies, users can ensure they have unique, residential IP addresses for each of their requests, thereby avoiding common IP-based blocking or throttling strategies employed by many websites.

## Key Features
Rotating Proxies: With each request, users are provided with a new residential IP, ensuring a high degree of anonymity and low block rates.

Persistent Connections: Users can opt to keep the connection active if they need to use the same IP for multiple requests.

Session Control: Databay offers a "[session](https://docs.databay.com/networks/residential-proxies/get-started/basic-query)" feature, allowing users to maintain the same IP across multiple requests even without a persistent connection.
